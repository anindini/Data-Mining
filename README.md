So You Want To Crowdfund?

This project was designed for a class I took at University called, CSC 240: Data Mining.

The dataset describes the creative and entrpreneurial ventures advertised on the Kickstarter Crowdfunding platform. It includes several attributes such as, goal,
country of origin, currency in which payment was requested, date of launch etc. Three classifiers, a decision tree, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and a Neural Network 
were applied to the data. 
Receiver Operating Charcteristic (ROC) curves were used to plot the false positive rate against the true positive rate for each classifier.
